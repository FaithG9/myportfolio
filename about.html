<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I enjoy learning new skills and putting them to the test. As a former Army soldier as well as a diesel/automotive mechanic, 
  learning new things doesn't typically pose an issue. I am so excited to be developing this new website that I hope everyone enjoys.</p>

<p>I like to stay busy with various things. I enjoy playing with my family, fixing my classic cars, and anything outdoors. I typically 
like to hike, kayak, fish, and swim. I find all my hobbies relaxing and enjoyable—that is, until I lose my 10 mm socket.

<p>I love to cook. Making various dishes without instructions, just to see how the food turns out, is such a nerve-wracking experience. 
I really enjoy frying chicken breasts, topping them with mushroom gravy, and popping them in the oven. Delicious!
